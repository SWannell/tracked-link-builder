To add a new form element to pull into the tracked link:

1) add new form element, with a new ID

2) If you want to show/hide it the new element:
- wrap it in a div
- reflect the new div in the show/hide rules within the function toggleFields()
- include the show/hide rule element within the call rules for toggleFields()

3) Make sure that the case rules link up the new element ID with an existing tracked link element
- Initialise the variable if necessary
