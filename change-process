To add a new form element to pull into the tracked link:

1) add new form element, with a new ID

2) If you want to show/hide the new element:
- wrap it in a div
- get the ID for the element that determines when the div is shown/hidden, and make sure that 'rule element' is being noticed by the call rules for toggleFields()
- reflect the new div ID in the show/hide rules within the actual toggleFields() function

3) Make sure that the case rules link up the new element ID with an existing tracked link element
- Initialise the variable if necessary

4) QA the report with https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pzD-kL0I-uG1RDmMqatHPOaYJfPGoVP5YEzHmm4lAZ0/edit#gid=1682837906
